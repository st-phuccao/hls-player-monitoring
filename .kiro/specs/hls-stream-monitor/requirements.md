# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HLS Stream Monitor is a professional web-based tool for comprehensive HLS stream monitoring and analysis. The system provides detailed real-time metrics based on HLS.js events, advanced performance tracking, and a modern dashboard interface for stream quality assessment and load testing purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want to monitor startup performance metrics, so that I can measure stream initialization efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN play() is called THEN the system SHALL start measuring startup time
2. WHEN the first video frame is rendered THEN the system SHALL calculate and display startup_time in milliseconds
3. WHEN startup measurement is complete THEN the system SHALL store the metric for server tracking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want to track rebuffering events and ratios, so that I can assess stream stability and user experience quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rebuffering event occurs THEN the system SHALL increment rebuffer_count
2. WHEN rebuffering starts THEN the system SHALL start measuring rebuffer_duration in seconds
3. WHEN rebuffering ends THEN the system SHALL add the duration to total rebuffer_duration
4. WHEN watch_time is available THEN the system SHALL calculate rebuffer_ratio as (rebuffer_duration / watch_time) * 100
5. WHEN rebuffering metrics are updated THEN the system SHALL display all three metrics in real-time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want to measure actual playback time, so that I can distinguish between active viewing and paused/buffering states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video is playing THEN the system SHALL accumulate total_playback_time (watch time)
2. WHEN video is paused THEN the system SHALL pause the playback time counter
3. WHEN video is buffering THEN the system SHALL not count buffering time as playback time
4. WHEN playback resumes THEN the system SHALL continue accumulating playback time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want to monitor frame drop statistics, so that I can assess video rendering performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video is playing THEN the system SHALL track dropped_frames using HLS.js events
2. WHEN video is playing THEN the system SHALL track total_frames rendered
3. WHEN frame data is available THEN the system SHALL calculate dropped_frame_ratio as (dropped_frames / total_frames) * 100
4. WHEN frame metrics change THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want to monitor frame rate performance, so that I can assess video smoothness and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video is playing THEN the system SHALL measure current fps
2. WHEN fps data is collected THEN the system SHALL track min_fps (minimum recorded)
3. WHEN fps data is collected THEN the system SHALL track max_fps (maximum recorded)
4. WHEN fps changes THEN the system SHALL update all frame rate metrics in real-time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want to monitor bitrate information, so that I can assess stream quality and adaptation behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stream is playing THEN the system SHALL display current_bitrate in kbps
2. WHEN bitrate changes occur THEN the system SHALL calculate avg_bitrate_played over the session
3. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL display current bandwidth estimation
4. WHEN bitrate metrics are updated THEN the system SHALL store data for server tracking

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want to monitor segment loading performance, so that I can assess network and CDN performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN segments are loaded THEN the system SHALL track max_segment_duration and min_segment_duration
2. WHEN segments are loaded THEN the system SHALL measure segment load times
3. WHEN segment load data is available THEN the system SHALL calculate avg_segment_load_time, min_segment_loadtime, and max_segment_loadtime
4. WHEN segments are successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL increment total_segment_loaded counter

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want to monitor playlist reload performance, so that I can assess manifest update efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playlist reloads occur THEN the system SHALL measure reload times
2. WHEN playlist reload data is available THEN the system SHALL calculate avg_playlist_reload_time
3. WHEN playlist reload data is available THEN the system SHALL track min_playlist_reload_time and max_playlist_reload_time
4. WHEN playlist metrics are updated THEN the system SHALL display all reload performance metrics

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want to track error rates and data consumption, so that I can assess overall stream health and bandwidth usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL calculate error percentage based on total events
2. WHEN data is loaded THEN the system SHALL accumulate total_data_loaded in GB
3. WHEN error or data metrics change THEN the system SHALL update displays in real-time
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy to 2 decimal places

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want an improved monitoring UI, so that I can have a better user experience when analyzing metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the monitoring interface loads THEN the system SHALL display all metrics in organized, readable panels
2. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL use professional styling with clear labels and units
3. WHEN the interface is used THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design for different screen sizes
4. WHEN metrics update THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations and visual indicators

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a stream analyst, I want metrics data structured for server transmission, so that I can send tracking data to analytics servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL organize data into a structured object or array
2. WHEN data structure is created THEN the system SHALL include all monitoring metrics with proper naming
3. WHEN data is ready THEN the system SHALL provide methods to serialize data for server transmission
4. WHEN data structure is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with server API requirements
